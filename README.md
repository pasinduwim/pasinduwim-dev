## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with experience in building scalable, efficient web applications. I recently completed a one-year internship at Rumex followed by 6 months as an Associate Software Engineer, where I honed my skills in modern web technologies.

My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, with a focus on creating clean, maintainable code and intuitive user experiences. I'm particularly interested in building robust architectures that can scale with business needs.

When I'm not coding, I'm continuously learning new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of web development. I believe in writing code that not only works but is also easy to understand and maintain.
